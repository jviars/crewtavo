/**
 * What a connected AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT and other MCP clients) may change. Each
 * connection starts out only reading; the person who connected it can let it change chosen areas,
 * give it full access, which also lets it delete, or full access without money (quotes, invoices,
 * payments, pay and promo codes). It never gets more than the person's own role (row-level security and the
 * database's own rules still apply), and some things stay out of reach whatever it's given: sign-in,
 * passwords and spare keys, connected apps and keys, and its own access.
 *
 * The web app's access picker, the MCP server (apps/api/src/mcp.ts) and the database
 * (private.assistant_may_change, in the assistant_areas migrations) use the same rules.
