-- Progress billing taxes the job's taxable share of what it bills. Its line was always taxable and
-- the final invoice credited it as taxable, but an invoice's taxable amount never goes below $0
-- (private.invoice_totals), so on a job that's only partly taxed the tax a progress invoice charged
-- on untaxed work never came back: with $1,000 of untaxed labour and $100 of taxed materials at 10%,
-- a $500 progress invoice charged $50.00 of tax and the final invoice $0.00, on a job that owes
-- $10.00. Now:
--
--   A progress invoice   bills the amount as a taxed line and an untaxed line, split by how much of
--                        the job's lines is taxable ($45.45 and $454.55 above), and never taxes more
--                        than the job's taxable work its earlier progress invoices left.
--   The final invoice    credits each progress invoice the way that invoice's own lines were taxed,
--                        so one made before this (or edited by hand) is credited as it was charged.
--
-- A fully taxable job comes out as before: one taxed line, one taxed credit. A job with nothing
-- taxable gets one untaxed line (it was taxed before, which was the same mistake). Each invoice
-- still rounds its own tax to the cent. Invoices already made aren't changed: an owner finds the
-- ones to look over with docs/queries/progress-invoice-tax-review.sql.

-- As in 20261106000530_visit_lines_keep_service.sql, except for a progress invoice's lines and the
-- final invoice's credit for them.
