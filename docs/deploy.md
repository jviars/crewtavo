# Running Crewtavo

Every business gets its **own Crewtavo instance**: the app plus its own database, sign-in, file
storage, separate from every other business. There are two ways to run one:

- **On Railway**, with one click. This is how most businesses will run it.
- **With Docker** on any computer or server (`npm run instance`), to self-host or to try it out.

Both run the same five services (`docker-compose.yml` with Docker, the Railway template on Railway):

| Service | What it does | Reachable from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crewtavo` | The web app, the API, background tasks (reminders, automations, recurring visits...). Also the front door to the services below. | The internet |
| `db` | Postgres, with the roles the services below sign in as (`deploy/postgres`) | Inside the instance |
| `auth` | Sign-in, invitations, password resets, and the sign-in Claude and ChatGPT use (Supabase Auth) | Inside the instance |
| `rest` | The data API the web app reads and writes through, with row-level security (PostgREST) | Inside the instance |
| `storage` | Photos, receipts and documents (Supabase Storage, on a volume) | Inside the instance |

Only `crewtavo` is public. It forwards `/auth/v1`, `/rest/v1` and `/storage/v1` to the others (`apps/api/src/lib/stack.ts`), creates their keys from one shared secret, and applies
database migrations every time it starts (`/api/health` answers once they're done). If the database
or one of the other services isn't up yet, it keeps trying by itself, a little later each time (five
minutes apart at most), and starts its background tasks once they are. Nobody has to copy keys or
run commands.

## On Railway

**For a business:** press **Deploy on Railway** in the [README](../README.md), sign in to Railway
(or create an account), and press **Deploy** again. After a few minutes, open the address Railway
shows on the **crewtavo** service and create the owner account. Then set up the business and invite
the team from **Settings → People**.

If something isn't right yet, the address shows a **Crewtavo is starting up** or **Finish setting up
Crewtavo** page that says what to do, instead of an error.

**Cost:** the business pays Railway directly. Measured on a new instance at rest: about 0.36 GB of
memory across the five services (Postgres 136 MB, Storage 124 MB, crewtavo 47 MB, rest 37 MB,
auth 12 MB), roughly $3.60 a month at Railway's $10 per GB-month. Railway's free trial (30 days, $5
of credit) is enough to try Crewtavo; to keep running, an instance needs Railway's Hobby plan ($5 a
month, including $5 of usage). Use grows with data and traffic; check
[Railway's pricing](https://railway.com/pricing), or **Settings → Hosting** in the instance.

**Connect Railway (required):** right after setting up the business, the owner is asked to **Log in
with Railway**. They're still signed in after deploying, so they press Authorize (Railway's
default is all their projects; **Change → Selected projects** limits it to this one). Crewtavo asks
for `project:member` only. It doesn't ask for `workspace:admin`, which billing would need: Railway
shows that to owners in red as "full control of your account", and a sign-in asking for both was
refused the project. Until Railway is connected, the owner sees this step whenever they open
Crewtavo; **Ask me tomorrow** lets them in for a day, for when Railway is down or someone else
looks after it (`railwayNeeded` in `apps/api/src/services/railway.ts`). A pasted project token
counts too.

**Settings → Hosting** (`apps/api/src/services/hosting.ts`) shows what Railway charges: this month
so far against what the plan includes, the last day's rate and a forecast for the month at it,
what each service used, the last week's memory and CPU, and how full the volumes are. Railway
reports usage in vCPU- and GB-minutes, priced at Railway's rates (they matched Railway's own
figure on a trial project). On the trial, the days and credit left are counted from when the
project was made. Plans, credit, the card and the usage limit open Railway's own pages. A task
twice a day (`hosting`) sends the owner and admins each new warning once, by the bell, email and
push (the `hosting` notification topic): the trial ending in about 7, 3 or 1 days or its credit
nearly gone, usage on track to go over what the plan includes, a volume over 85% full, or a
Railway sign-in that stopped working. These usage queries are the ones Railway's dashboard uses
but aren't in Railway's API docs, so each is optional: what Railway doesn't share is left out.
A storage bucket isn't in Railway's usage figures, so it's priced from what it holds now ($0.015 per
GB a month) and added to the month, and it's shown without a size, since it never fills up.

**Files storage:** photos and files are kept on the `storage` service's volume. **Settings →
Hosting → Files storage** can move them into a Railway bucket instead, with one press (see
[Moving files to a bucket](#moving-files-to-a-bucket)).

**Your own domain:** after connecting Railway, the owner sees **Your web address**: four steps on a
timeline, ticked off as they're done, with what to do now opened under the current one.
1. **Log in with Railway.** Already done by the step above.
2. **Choose your domain.** "Do you already have a domain?"
   - **Yes, use mine:** the address box starts with `crm.` and they type their domain after it.
   - **No, get me one:** opens Railway's Buy a Domain on the crewtavo service. Railway attaches it and
     runs its DNS, and Crewtavo offers to switch to it as soon as it shows up on the service.
3. **Connect your domain:** the two DNS records, with steps for their DNS provider, or **Email the
   steps** to whoever looks after the domain. A domain bought on Railway skips this.
4. **Crewtavo switches over** by itself.

The web address can be skipped. **Settings → Web address** shows the same steps any time, and businesses set up
before this see them only there. With Railway connected, Crewtavo adds the address to the crewtavo
service and shows the two DNS records Railway wants, with steps for the domain's DNS provider. On Cloudflare it can add
them itself, from a token used once and never stored. Then it checks the records live. Once Railway has verified the
address and issued its certificate, and the address answers as this instance, Crewtavo does the rest:
- sets `APP_URL`
- redeploys `auth` and `crewtavo`
- tells the admins

Pages on the old address forward to the new one. Client links, calendar feeds, the Twilio webhook and
assistant connectors keep working on both addresses.

Crewtavo keeps its Railway access afterwards, encrypted, so later features don't ask again. A daily
task refreshes it before Railway's sign-in runs out, and **Remove access** in Settings → Web address
or Hosting ends it. Each instance registers its own client with Railway, so there's no shared app to run. If
Railway won't register it, the screen asks for a project token instead. By hand (under **Can't log
in with Railway?** in step 1), the steps are:
1. In the crewtavo service, **Settings → Networking → Custom Domain**.
2. Change its `APP_URL` variable to `https://your-domain`.
3. Redeploy `crewtavo` and `auth`.

The screen lists these steps with links, and notices when they're done.

**Backups:** Crewtavo backs up its own database every night, on every Railway plan (see
[Database backups](#database-backups)), and the owner downloads a backup from **Settings → Your
data** to keep a copy outside Railway. Photos and files aren't in it. Railway's volume backups
(open the `db` or `storage` volume, then **Backups**) cover those too but need Railway's Pro plan,
and Railway doesn't back up storage buckets at all, so once files are in a bucket, the volume's
backups stop covering anything added since (see
[Moving files to a bucket](#moving-files-to-a-bucket)). Whatever someone deletes in Crewtavo waits
30 days in the Trash first (see [Crewtavo - Drive](#crewtavo---drive)).

**Secrets to keep:** save `JWT_SECRET` (and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, if you set one) and
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` somewhere outside Railway, such as a password manager. They exist only in the
project's variables, and a backup is only half of what a restore needs:

- **Without `JWT_SECRET`** (or `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, when that's set) a restored Crewtavo can't read its
  connected apps (Stripe, QuickBooks, Google, the business's mailbox, Railway), so each has to be
  connected again; the owner's key file stops working; and links already sent to clients (quotes,
  invoices, the Client Hub) stop opening. Everyone can still sign in with their password.
- **Without `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`** the services can't sign in to a database volume you kept or
  restored from Railway's volume backups. (A new instance restored from a downloaded backup gets a
  new one of its own.)

**Where they are:** in the Railway project, open the **crewtavo** service, then **Variables**, for
`JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and the **db** service's **Variables** for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`;
the eye next to each shows its value. Copy them the day you deploy. Crewtavo itself never shows them.

**Updates:** Crewtavo keeps itself up to date. When a new version comes out, Railway installs it
within several hours, with no downtime: the new version starts next to the old one, updates the
database, and takes over only once it's working; if something goes wrong, the old one keeps
running. Railway notifies the workspace's admins after each update. The `db` service gets a new
version only when its setup changes, overnight (02:00–06:00 UTC), and is down for about a minute
while it restarts. Every new version installs itself, big ones included. The one exception is a
move to a new major version of Postgres, the database, which has to convert your data first; its
release notes say what to do. To see which version you're running, open
`https://your-address/api/health`. To change when updates install, or to turn them off, open the
service's **Settings → Source → Configure auto updates**. To stay on one version, change the image
there from `ghcr.io/jviars/crewtavo:latest` to that version, such as `ghcr.io/jviars/crewtavo:0.2.0`.
Going back to a version older than one your Crewtavo has already run doesn't undo an update: the
database has moved on, and parts of the older version may not work with it. It still starts, and
says so in its log and at `/api/health` (`"problem":"newer_database"`).

When an update takes over, the old version finishes the requests and background tasks it had under
way before it stops, if Railway gives it the time. Open the `crewtavo` service's **Variables**: if
`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_DRAINING_SECONDS` isn't there (it isn't on a Crewtavo deployed before the
template had it), add it with the value `30`. Without it Railway stops the old version at once,
which can cut off a request or a task half-way.

**Locked out?** See [Getting back in](#getting-back-in).

**Making the template** (once, by whoever publishes Crewtavo): see [deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md).

## With Docker

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jviars/crewtavo.git
cd crewtavo
npm run instance
```

The first run writes `.env.instance` with new secrets (keep it: the database is locked with them),
builds Crewtavo, starts the five services and prints the address, http://localhost:8080. Then:

```bash
npm run instance -- logs    # follow what's happening
npm run instance -- stop    # stop it; the data stays in Docker volumes
docker compose --env-file .env.instance down -v   # delete the instance and all its data
```

**On a server:** set `APP_URL=https://your-domain` in `.env.instance`, run `npm run instance` again,
and put a web server with HTTPS in front of port 8080 (`CREWTAVO_PORT`) on the same server, since
the port only answers there. With Caddy, this `Caddyfile` does it:

```
your-domain {
  reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Caddy adds each visitor's address to `X-Forwarded-For`, which Crewtavo's rate limits go by (see
[Visitors' addresses](#visitors-addresses)). Another web server has to add it the same way (nginx:
`proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`). A Caddyfile with a
`header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}` line, from earlier versions of these steps, works as it is.

**Updating from an earlier version:** Crewtavo used to go by `X-Real-IP`. A web server that only
sets that one (nginx's `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;`) needs the `X-Forwarded-For` line
above as well, or `CREWTAVO_VISITOR_IP=x-real-ip` in `.env.instance`. Without either, visitors can
pick their own address, and everyone who doesn't shares the web server's. Port 8080 also used to
answer on every address; now it only answers on the server itself. If your web server runs on
another machine, see [Visitors' addresses](#visitors-addresses).

**Backups:** Crewtavo backs up its own database every night (see
[Database backups](#database-backups)); download one from **Settings → Your data** now and then
and keep it on another computer. For photos and files too, back up the
`crewtavo-instance_db-data` and `crewtavo-instance_storage-data` Docker volumes, and
`.env.instance`. Files stay on the `storage-data` volume: moving them to a bucket is for instances
on Railway.

**Secrets to keep:** save a copy of `.env.instance` somewhere off this computer. It holds
`JWT_SECRET` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, if you set one), and what stops working
without them is the same as on Railway (see **Secrets to keep** [above](#on-railway)): without
`JWT_SECRET` a restored Crewtavo can't read its connected apps, the owner's key file stops working
and links already sent to clients stop opening; without `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` the services can't sign
in to the `db-data` volume.

For working on Crewtavo's code, the faster loop is in the README's **Develop** section.

## Optional settings

Everything an instance needs is generated. These turn on extra features; add them to the
**crewtavo** service's **Variables** on Railway, or to `.env.instance` with Docker (`.env.example`
lists them all).

| Name | Turns on |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_URL` | Your own domain (see above; **Settings → Web address** sets it on Railway). Defaults to the instance's address. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | A separate key for encrypting app tokens and signing client links: 32+ random bytes in base64, or any 32+ characters. Without it, one is derived from the instance's secret. **Keep it stable once set**: changing it disconnects every app and invalidates links already sent to clients. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional `AI_MODEL`) | AI rewrite and SOP answers. Companies can also add their own key on the Apps page. |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY` | Optional. Measure works without any key (free US and state imagery); this adds Google satellite as a choice for every company. Enable the Map Tiles API and restrict the key to it and your domain. Companies can instead add Esri or Google keys themselves in **Settings → Maps**. |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_KEY` | Roof pitch suggestions (Solar API). Restrict it to the Solar API. |
| `QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID`, `QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT` | Not needed for most businesses: each one makes its own Intuit app and pastes its keys under **Apps → QuickBooks Online**, which walks them through it (and wins over these when both are there). These set up one Intuit app on the server instead: create it at developer.intuit.com; the redirect URI is shown on the Apps page. |
| `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZOHO_ACCOUNTS_URL` | Not needed for most businesses: each one makes its own Zoho app and pastes its keys under **Apps → Zoho Books** (which wins over these when both are there). These set up one Zoho app on the server instead: create a server-based client at api-console.zoho.com. |
| `GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY` | Import from Google Drive in **Drive**, with `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (no secret needed). A browser API key restricted to the Google Picker API, your domain and `https://docs.google.com/*`; see [Importing from Google Drive](#importing-from-google-drive). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google Calendar: show a company's Google calendars on the schedule and put visits on a Google calendar Crewtavo makes. In Google Cloud, turn on the Google Calendar API, set up the OAuth consent screen with the scopes `calendar.calendarlist.readonly`, `calendar.events.readonly` and `calendar.app.created`, and create a Web application client whose redirect URI is the one shown on the Google Calendar app page (`https://your-domain/api/apps/google_calendar/callback`). Then, under **Audience**, publish the app (or choose **Internal** on Google Workspace): while it's in **Testing**, Google ends sign-ins after 7 days and Google Calendar disconnects. Optional: without these, Google Calendar works by secret address both ways (the Apps page walks people through it), and calendar files can be uploaded under **Settings → Calendars**. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Not needed for most businesses: connect Stripe on the **Apps** page instead (see [Connecting Stripe](#connecting-stripe)). These share one Stripe account with every company on the server that hasn't connected its own (so **Bring in your Stripe history** works with it only on a one-company server). Point a webhook at `/api/webhooks/stripe` with API version `2024-06-20` and the events in `STRIPE_EVENTS` (`apps/api/src/integrations/stripe.ts`): `invoice.*` (finalized, paid, payment_failed, payment_action_required, voided, marked_uncollectible), `payment_intent.processing`, `charge.refunded`, `charge.dispute.created`, `charge.dispute.closed`, `payout.*` (created, updated, paid, failed, canceled), `checkout.session.*` (completed, async_payment_succeeded, async_payment_failed), `setup_intent.*` (succeeded, setup_failed), `payment_method.*` (detached, automatically_updated) and `mandate.updated`. The setup_intent, payment_method and mandate events are for autopay, which needs the company's own key, so the server's account never acts on them. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` | Optional default sender through [Resend](https://resend.com), used until the business connects its own email under **Settings → Email**. That screen recommends Resend (the business's own free account, which works on every Railway plan); a mailbox over SMTP only works on Railway Pro or when self-hosting, since Railway's trial and Hobby plans block outgoing mail servers. Subs on a new phone can also sign in with a 6-digit code emailed this way (the business's own mailbox first): it's how they get back in when texting isn't set up, and when it is, for a sub with no phone on file. |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` | Text messages. For two-way texting, set the number's **Messaging > A message comes in** webhook to `https://your-domain/api/webhooks/twilio` (HTTP POST). Replies appear in Messages and notify the office. `APP_URL` must match that address exactly, because Twilio signs the full URL. Subs on a new phone can also sign in with a 6-digit code texted from this number, so list one-time passcodes as a use in the number's A2P 10DLC registration. |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | Bot protection on public booking and referral forms. |
| `CREWTAVO_SCHEDULER` | Set to `off` on extra replicas of `crewtavo`, so background tasks run in one place. |
| `CREWTAVO_VISITOR_IP` | Only when something other than Railway's edge or one web server is in front of Crewtavo: where visitors' addresses come from (see [Visitors' addresses](#visitors-addresses)). |
| `CREWTAVO_BIND` | Docker only: the address port 8080 answers on. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`, the computer itself, which is all a web server there needs; read [Visitors' addresses](#visitors-addresses) before changing it. |
| `CREWTAVO_SENTRY_DSN` | Error tracking for the API and the web app (see below). Unset turns it off. |
| `CREWTAVO_SENTRY_WEB_DSN` | Optional: send the web app's errors to a separate project. Defaults to `CREWTAVO_SENTRY_DSN`. |
| `CREWTAVO_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | Optional: the environment shown on each report, such as `staging`. Defaults to `production`. |

### Visitors' addresses

Public pages (booking forms, promo codes, Client Hub payments and messages, sign-in links, the
first-run setup) limit how often each visitor can use them, by address, and a quote approval
records the address it came from. Anyone can send their own `X-Real-IP` or `X-Forwarded-For`
header, so Crewtavo only goes by what the instance's own proxy sets:

- **On Railway:** `X-Real-IP`, which Railway's edge sets on every request in place of anything
  the visitor sent.
- **With Docker or on your own server:** the last `X-Forwarded-For` entry, which the web server in
  front adds, on connections from the same machine or a private network (where that web server
  connects from). Connections from anywhere else count by their own address.

With Docker, port 8080 only answers on the server itself (`CREWTAVO_BIND`, `127.0.0.1` by
default), so the web server there is the only way in. Keep it that way with a web server in front:
Docker hands some outside connections to Crewtavo from its own network address (over IPv6, and on
Docker Desktop or rootless Docker often all of them), and Crewtavo would take them for the web
server's and believe their `X-Forwarded-For`.

- **Web server on another machine:** set `CREWTAVO_BIND` to this server's address on the private
  network between them, not `0.0.0.0`.
- **No web server** (trying Crewtavo from other computers on your network): set
  `CREWTAVO_BIND=0.0.0.0` and `CREWTAVO_VISITOR_IP=connection`. On Docker Desktop, everyone then
  counts as one visitor.
- **Without Docker:** close port 8080 to other computers with the server's firewall.

Sign-in and file storage get the same address from Crewtavo (Auth records it with each sign-in).
With something else in front, set `CREWTAVO_VISITOR_IP`:

| Value | When |
| --- | --- |
| `x-forwarded-for:2` | Two proxies add to `X-Forwarded-For`, such as Cloudflare's proxy in front of Caddy. Caddy keeps Cloudflare's entries only from addresses in its `trusted_proxies` setting, so list Cloudflare's there. The number counts the proxies. |
| `cf-connecting-ip`, `x-real-ip` (or another header) | The proxy in front sets this header to the visitor's address, replacing any the visitor sent (nginx's `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;` does). |
| `connection` | Nothing is in front: the address each connection comes from. |

Once set, it's believed on every connection, so nothing may reach Crewtavo without going through
those proxies: keep port 8080 on the server (above), and let the web server take connections only
from the proxy in front of it (for Cloudflare, allow only [Cloudflare's addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/)
in the server's firewall). Caddy with `x-forwarded-for:2` doesn't need the firewall, since it
replaces the `X-Forwarded-For` of anyone outside `trusted_proxies`; nginx adds to it.

### Error tracking

Set `CREWTAVO_SENTRY_DSN` to a project's DSN from [Sentry](https://sentry.io) (Project Settings >
Client Keys). The API reports crashes and unexpected database errors, background tasks report when
they fail, and the web app reports screen crashes and code errors. Nothing is collected until the
variable is set, and the browser only downloads the reporting code when it is.

A self-hosted [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com) works the same way: it accepts the Sentry SDK, so
paste its DSN (Project > Settings > DSN) into `CREWTAVO_SENTRY_DSN`. Any other Sentry-compatible
service works too.

Reports are errors only (no performance tracing, session tracking or replays), and personal data is
removed before anything leaves the server or the browser (`packages/core/src/privacy.ts`):

- request bodies, cookies, query strings and headers (except the browser's User-Agent) are never sent;
- no user is attached: no email, IP address or account id;
- email addresses, phone numbers, sign-in tokens and client links (`/hub/...`, `/u/...`) are masked
  in error messages, breadcrumbs and extra data.

The SDK leaves IP addresses out, but you can also turn on **Prevent Storing of IP Addresses** in
the Sentry project's security settings so the server never infers them.

---

## After the first sign-in

- **Settings → Email**: connect Resend (recommended, and the only option on Railway's trial and Hobby plans,
  which block SMTP): the screen walks through making a free Resend account, adding the domain and creating a
  Sending access API key, with a button to each page. Or, self-hosted or on Railway Pro, connect the business
  mailbox (Gmail, Google Workspace, Zoho, Microsoft 365, Yahoo, iCloud or any SMTP server) with an app password.
  Crewtavo sends you a test before saving. Quotes, invoices, reminders, team invites, password resets and team
  notifications then go out from that address. (Until it's connected, invites show a link to copy and text instead.)
- **Settings → People and Roles**: invite the team. Starter roles: General manager, Office manager
  (invoices and payroll), Operations manager, Foreman (runs their own crew, no prices) and Employee.
- **Settings → Profile → Notifications** (each person): turn on notifications for their phone and
  choose what also comes by email or text. On an iPhone, add Crewtavo to the Home Screen first
  (Share → Add to Home Screen) and open it from there. Phone notifications are free and need no setup.
  Where the browser offers it (Chrome or Edge, on Android or a computer), **Install the app** is
  there too, and on the crew's Home and My day, where crews in Safari on an iPhone get the Home
  Screen steps instead. Crew updates made with no signal go out once Crewtavo is on the screen with
  signal; on Android, if it's put away or closed by then, a notification says how many are waiting.
- **Company settings**: address (used for route starts and email footers), payment terms, tax rate and brand color.
- **Marketing > Reviews**: paste your Google review link so review requests point at it.
- **Marketing > Referrals**: set the reward you offer, if any.
- **Automations**: the starter rules are on; adjust their wording or delays, or add your own.
- **Finance > Overview**: an admin can set the yearly revenue goal and a target job margin.

## Connecting Stripe

Open **Apps**, then **Stripe**, and click **Get a key from Stripe**. Stripe opens its form for a new
restricted key named Crewtavo with the permissions it needs already set (most rows stay at None):
scroll to the bottom, click **Create key**, enter the code Stripe sends you, copy the key and paste
it into Crewtavo. Crewtavo checks it and adds the webhook it needs to your Stripe account, so
there's nothing else to set up. A sandbox key (`rk_test_` or `sk_test_`) works the same way, with
no real money. A full secret key (`sk_live_`) works too, but a restricted key is strongly preferred:
the secret key can do anything in your Stripe account, including payouts, so if it ever leaked it
would give away far more than Crewtavo needs, while the restricted key only has what Crewtavo uses
and can't make payouts. Crewtavo warns while you paste a secret key, and the Stripe card keeps
asking you to swap it for a restricted one (then delete the secret key in Stripe).
Connecting, replacing or removing the key asks for your Crewtavo password, is recorded in the
activity, and every owner gets a notice about it (and an email, once email is set up). A
restricted key made by hand needs write
access to webhook endpoints, customers and invoices, and read access to balance, balance
transaction sources, charges, payouts and the account. Autopay and refunds from Crewtavo also need
write access to Checkout Sessions, SetupIntents, PaymentMethods, PaymentIntents and refunds; a key
from before autopay shows **Update your key to turn on autopay** on the Stripe card. When the
webhook Crewtavo added listens for fewer events than it now needs, opening the Apps page (or
Settings → Payments) brings it up to date with the key you have.

Then:

- **Sending an invoice** also creates it in Stripe, so it shows in your Stripe dashboard. Crewtavo
  emails or texts the client as before; Stripe doesn't. The **Pay** button in the Client Hub opens
  Stripe's page for that invoice. A client can't pay it twice, a bank payment shows as on its way
  until it clears (no reminders meanwhile, and the invoice page says when it started and asks
  before you record another payment, which could have the client pay twice), and a check you
  record replaces the Stripe invoice with one for what's still owed. A few cents left, less than
  Stripe can charge (50¢ in dollars), aren't put in Stripe: collect them another way. A sent
  invoice moved back to draft can be deleted once its Stripe invoice is voided, a few minutes
  later (if Stripe can't be reached to void it, void the invoice instead).
- **Invoices you make in Stripe** (a one-off or a big job you'd rather bill by hand) come into
  Crewtavo on their own, matched to the client by email or added as a new client, and their
  payments are recorded when they're paid. Stripe asks the client for what it billed, so record a
  payment on one in Stripe, not in Crewtavo: mark it paid there when the client paid all of it, or
  issue a credit note there for what they paid when it's part of it, so Stripe asks for only the
  rest. The credit note is recorded here once the invoice is paid in Stripe.
- **Payments** record the fee Stripe kept, and **Invoices → Stripe deposits** shows each payout to
  your bank with the payments in it. Refunds, failed bank payments and disputes show up on their own.
  A client's balance in Stripe goes on their next Stripe invoice: credit they had is recorded on
  that invoice, and money they owed from before as a payment from them that isn't on the invoice
  (a refund or a lost dispute of that charge takes it back too). When credit pays all of an
  invoice and the client adds a tip in the Client Hub, Stripe charges only the tip: that's recorded
  as a payment of just the tip, with its fee and deposit. A credit note you issue in Stripe
  before the invoice is paid is recorded on it, so it isn't asked for again. Tips aren't sent to
  QuickBooks or Zoho Books (they aren't on the invoice there); Finance shows them.
- **Bring in your Stripe history** on the Stripe card imports past invoices, their clients and
  payments, and deposits, from a date you choose. History comes in quietly: no automations,
  reminders or notifications. Running it again only updates what's already there. On the
  server's own Stripe account (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`) it only runs when the server has one company,
  since that account is shared. With a key that can use them, it also brings in the card each
  customer saved in Stripe, for clients matched by the link Crewtavo keeps or by an email only
  they have. Nothing is charged until the client confirms autopay or the owner records that they
  agreed.
- **Autopay** (Settings → Payments, with your own key): a client saves a card or bank account on
  Stripe's page, agrees to the terms, and each finished visit is charged to it as a Stripe invoice
  that Stripe charges at once. Turn off Stripe's own emails about failed payments and receipts, so
  clients don't get two. **Refund** on an invoice's Stripe payment refunds it in Stripe and records
  it at once.

**Replacing the key** (**Replace key** on Stripe's page in **Apps**) only takes over once Crewtavo has added
the webhook with the new key; if it can't, Stripe stays connected as it was. When the new key is
for another Stripe account, or it's your live key after a test one, Crewtavo stops using the old
account: its open invoices are voided there (any paid meanwhile are recorded), and clients get a
new Stripe invoice in the new account when they pay. **Disconnecting** does the same. A bank
payment still clearing in the old account is left alone, so the client isn't asked to pay twice;
a note on the client reminds you to record it once it clears there. Cards saved for autopay stay in
the old account, so autopay ends for those clients and you're told which need to set it up again.

Stripe only sends webhooks to a public `https` address, so on a local copy the key is saved
without one. Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8787/api/webhooks/stripe` and use the
deployment settings above to try webhooks there.

## Crewtavo - Drive

**Apps → Crewtavo - Drive → Install** (owners, and admins who connect apps) puts **Drive** in the
menu for owners, admins, office staff and estimators: every file in Crewtavo in one place. **Company
files** is a folder tree for documents that belong to no client (forms, price sheets, insurance
papers); **Clients** shows every file on clients' properties, requests, quotes and jobs, grouped by
client; then **Recent**, **Search** and **Trash**. PDFs open in Crewtavo to read, mark up and fill in,
Word documents to read and edit, and photos to zoom; saving an edit always makes a new version, so
nothing is written over. A file can be attached to a client's property, request, quote or job (the
crew sees it there when it's shown to crew), or kept office-only.

On Railway, Drive's files go in a bucket, not the volume (a full volume stops every upload). So
**Install** first makes the `files` bucket with Crewtavo's Railway connection and starts
[moving files to it](#moving-files-to-a-bucket); Drive is installed while they copy. When it
can't (Railway isn't connected in **Settings → Hosting**, or Railway won't let Crewtavo make or
deploy the bucket), Drive isn't installed, and the page says what to do before pressing
**Install** again. Off Railway, files stay where storage keeps them.

Uploads go up in 6 MB pieces and carry on where they left off, so a big plan set gets past a proxy
that caps a request at 100 MB (Cloudflare's free plan does) and survives patchy signal. Storage keeps
an unfinished upload for a day (`TUS_URL_EXPIRY_MS` on the `storage` service; instances made before
October 2026 don't have it and keep one for an hour, after which it starts over).

**The Trash:** whatever someone deletes in Crewtavo, in Drive or anywhere else (visit and quote
photos, receipts, sub paperwork, résumés, guide covers, equipment and ticket photos), goes to the
Trash for 30 days, where it can be restored. Nobody signed in can delete a stored file any more: the
server's nightly `trash` task (04:35 UTC) deletes what has been there 30 days, and an owner can
**Delete forever** sooner. Drive's Trash works whether or not Drive is installed (`/drive/trash`).

### Importing from Google Drive

With `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY` set, Drive's **Import from Google Drive** opens
Google's own file picker. People sign in to Google there and pick files; Crewtavo can read only the
files they pick (the `drive.file` permission), downloads them on the server, and forgets the sign-in
straight away (it's never stored or logged). Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drawings come in as
Word, Excel, PDF and PNG files (Google converts up to 10 MB each). In Google Cloud, in the same
project as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (Google Calendar's, if you've set that up):

1. **APIs & Services → Library:** enable the **Google Picker API** and the **Google Drive API**.
2. **Google Auth Platform → Clients:** in the Web application client, add every address people open
   Crewtavo at under **Authorized JavaScript origins** (`https://crm.example.com`, and the
   `*.up.railway.app` one if it's used). Import needs no redirect URI.
3. **Data Access:** add the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`. Google lists it as
   non-sensitive, so it needs no security review. Publish the app under **Audience** (or choose
   **Internal** on Google Workspace): while it's in **Testing**, only its test users can sign in.
4. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → API key.** Under **Application
   restrictions**, choose **Websites** and add `https://your-domain/*` and `https://docs.google.com/*`
   (without the second, the picker says the developer key is invalid). Under **API restrictions**,
   choose the Google Picker API. Set it as `GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY`.

The picker also needs the project's number, which Crewtavo reads from the start of the client ID.
The server checks each import's Google sign-in was made for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and refuses any other.

## Moving files to a bucket

On Railway, photos and files live on the `storage` service's volume. A Railway storage bucket keeps
them for a tenth of the price ($0.015 per GB a month instead of $0.15) and has no size to outgrow,
but Railway's Limited Trial has no buckets, and Railway backs up volumes (on Pro) but never buckets.
So the template keeps the volume, and an owner or admin can move files from **Settings → Hosting →
Files storage** (`apps/api/src/services/storageBucket.ts`); installing Drive does it too:

1. Crewtavo makes a bucket named `files` in the project, in the region the services run in.
2. It copies every file into it, a few at a time, skipping any already there, then copies whatever
   was uploaded meanwhile, and checks the bucket has every file, each at its size.
3. It switches `storage` to the bucket (`STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`, and the bucket's address and keys as
   references to the bucket's own variables) and restarts it, which takes about a minute. Uploads
   are turned away for that minute ("Try again in a minute"), opening files carries on, and
   anything that still lands on the volume is copied across.
4. It checks files open from the bucket.

The page shows each step and how many files are copied; it's fine to leave it. If Crewtavo restarts
partway (a new version, say), the move carries on from where it was the next time an owner or admin
opens Settings → Hosting. **The volume isn't touched**: it keeps every file from
before the move (and Railway keeps charging for what it holds), so **Move back to the volume** can
switch storage back and copy back what was added since. That includes files deleted for good after
the move, which go from the bucket but stay on the volume: once you're sure you won't move back,
delete the volume in Railway (open `storage`, then the volume, then **Settings**) to stop paying for
it and to be rid of them. The same goes the other way: the bucket keeps its copy after a move back,
so delete it in Railway once you're sure.

What it costs besides: Railway counts files sent into a bucket as the `storage` service's outbound
traffic ($0.05 per GB), so the copy costs that once for what you have, and new uploads count the same
way. **Settings → Hosting** adds the bucket to the month.

If Railway doesn't let Crewtavo do a step (a project token, or a Railway sign-in that can't change
the project), the page lists what to do in Railway instead, with the variables to paste, and carries
on when it's done. By hand, without Crewtavo, a move back is: on the `storage` service, set
`STORAGE_BACKEND` to `file` and `STORAGE_S3_BUCKET` to `crewtavo` (the volume's folder: left on the
bucket's name, storage looks for every file in the wrong place), then deploy. Files uploaded while
storage was on the bucket stay in the bucket that way.

## Storage limits

**Settings → Storage** (owners, and admins who manage settings) shows how much the company's photos
and files take up, how much of that is in the Trash (it takes up room until it's deleted for good),
who uploaded what and which parts of Crewtavo it's in, and the company's limit. Everyone with Drive
sees the company's total on the Drive page.

**The company limit** stops uploads before Crewtavo runs out of room or runs up the bill. Unless an
owner or admin sets one of their own (a number of GB, or **No limit**), it's a bit under what Railway
allows, read from Railway whenever Crewtavo checks it (Settings → Hosting, Settings → Storage, the
server's tasks, and after files move to or from a bucket):

| Where files are | Default limit |
|---|---|
| On the `storage` service's volume | 90% of the volume's size (4.5 GB of Hobby's 5 GB volume). Make the volume bigger in Railway and the default follows. |
| In a bucket, on Railway's Hobby plan | 900 GB. Hobby's buckets hold 1 TB across the whole Railway workspace, not just this project. |
| In a bucket, on Railway's Pro plan | 1 TB. Pro has no cap, so this is a safety net: 1 TB costs about $15 a month in a bucket. |
| Not on Railway, or Railway not connected | No default limit. Set one in Settings → Storage if you want one. |

A default Railway gave earlier goes when Crewtavo leaves Railway or Railway is disconnected (or
Railway's answer gives no default, such as a plan Crewtavo doesn't know). While Railway just can't
be reached for a moment, the last default stays.

The page shows what the limit would cost a month if it filled ($0.015 per GB in a bucket, $0.15 per
GB on a volume).

**Limits for people:** an owner can also give a person, or everyone with a role, a limit of their own
for what they upload (a person's own wins over their role's). It counts what they uploaded that isn't
in the Trash, so moving old files there frees it up. Owners are never limited.

**What's refused:** the server checks each upload's size before it's stored, and refuses one that
would go over with "This 240 MB file doesn't fit: 44.9 GB of the 45 GB storage limit is used…" (the
company's limit) or "This 240 MB file doesn't fit in your storage: you've used 9.9 GB of your
10 GB…" (a person's), which the app shows as it is. Before it refuses, it reads the numbers again,
so raising a limit or emptying the Trash counts straight away.
- Only uploads by someone signed in on the team are checked: the server checks their sign-in the
  way the storage service does, and only someone on the company's team is ever told its numbers.
  An upload link a team member made counts as theirs; one the server made (a booking form's, a
  sub's) is nobody's.
- The company limit refuses Drive and plan files, guide covers, résumés, chat files and equipment
  photos, and files from Google Drive.
- A person's limit refuses only Drive and plan files (Google Drive imports too) and guide covers.
- Nothing a crew needs to finish a job is ever refused: visit and quote photos, receipts, sub
  paperwork, ticket photos and Measure pictures always go in (they still count). Neither is anything
  the server stores itself (profile photos, the logo, letterheads, package and price-list pictures),
  a booking form's or a sub's upload link, or a move to a bucket.
- A few uploads at the same moment can go a little over; the limit catches up within half a minute.
- An upload has to say its size where a limit could refuse it (Crewtavo's own uploads always do),
  and Storage's S3 address takes no uploads: files go in through Crewtavo.

**Warnings:** the `storage` task (every 6 hours, on Railway or not) tells owners and admins, by the
bell, when the company's files reach 80% and then 95% of the limit (or that storage is full, when
it's already at the limit), and by email and push unless they've turned it off in Settings →
Profile, where it's the **Railway** topic on Railway and the **Storage and backups** topic elsewhere. Each is sent once;
when use drops back under (the Trash was emptied, or the limit raised), it's sent again the next
time it's reached.

## Database backups

Every instance backs up its own database, on Railway (any plan) and with Docker, with nothing to
set up (`apps/api/src/services/backups.ts`). The owner sees them under **Settings → Your data →
Database backups**.

- **What's in one:** the whole database: clients, quotes, jobs, invoices, payments, the team,
  everyone's sign-in, settings and connected apps (still encrypted). It's one file made by
  `pg_dump`, compressed. The demo business's is 3 MB and takes about two seconds to make; it grows
  with the business's records, not its photos.
- **What isn't:** photos and files (visit photos, receipts, plans, documents). They live on the
  `storage` service's volume or bucket, and are only covered if that's backed up separately: Railway's
  volume backups (Pro plan), or a copy of the Docker volume. A restore without them shows them as
  missing.
- **When:** every night after 2 in the morning, by the business's time zone. A night that fails is
  tried twice more, an hour apart. A new instance makes its first within an hour of being set up,
  and so does every instance after updating to the version that brought backups. **Back up now**
  makes one at any time.
- **How many are kept:** the last of each of the 7 most recent days, and of each of the 4 most
  recent weeks: about 9 files. Older ones are deleted.
- **Where they're kept:** in the instance's own Storage, in a private bucket named `backups` that
  only the server reads (no signed-in person's key can, the owner's included), in pieces of 16 MB.
  They take room on the `storage` volume (or in the bucket, after files moved there) but don't
  count toward the company's storage limit. **They're on the same Railway project (or server) as
  the database they back up**, so if the project is deleted or the account is lost, they go with
  it. Download one now and then and keep it somewhere else: that's the copy that survives.
- **Downloading:** only the owner, and the list, each download and Back up now ask for their
  password. A download goes in the activity and on every owner's bell. The file holds everything,
  pay rates and clients' details included, so keep it somewhere safe.
- **Warnings:** the owners hear, by the bell and by email and push (the **Railway** topic; **Storage
  and backups** off Railway), when a night's backup has failed all three tries, and when there's
  been no good backup for over two days. Settings → Your data says why the last one failed.
- **Where it doesn't run:** an instance started without Crewtavo's Docker image (no `pg_dump`), or
  a Crewtavo pointed at a database it doesn't run itself. Settings → Your data says so.

A backup made on Postgres 17 restores into Postgres 17 or newer. If the `db` service is ever moved to
a newer major version than the `crewtavo` image's `pg_dump`, backups fail and the owners are told.

## Restoring a backup

A backup goes into a **new** Crewtavo instance, which then has everything the old one had when the
backup was made: the same business, people, passwords and data. You need:

- the backup file you downloaded (`crewtavo-backup-….dump`);
- the old instance's `JWT_SECRET` (and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, if you had set one). Without it the restore
  still works and everyone can sign in, but connected apps (Stripe, QuickBooks, Google, the business's
  mailbox, Railway) have to be connected again, the owner's key file stops working, and links
  already sent to clients (quotes, invoices, the Client Hub) stop opening;
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your computer.

Photos and files aren't in the backup. If you also have the old `storage` volume (or its bucket),
attach it to the new instance's `storage` service before step 1; otherwise they show as missing.

`scripts/restore.mjs` does the work. It refuses an instance that already has a business in it
unless you add `--replace`, and it either restores everything or changes nothing.

### With Docker

1. On the computer that will run Crewtavo, get the code as in [With Docker](#with-docker):
   `git clone https://github.com/jviars/crewtavo.git`, then `cd crewtavo`.
2. Put your saved `.env.instance` in that folder. If you only saved `JWT_SECRET`, run
   `npm run instance` once to make a new `.env.instance`, then replace its `JWT_SECRET=` line with
   yours.
3. Restore, naming the backup file:

   ```bash
   npm run instance -- restore ~/Downloads/crewtavo-backup-20261112-0805.dump
   ```

   It starts the instance, puts the backup in, and starts everything again. It takes a few minutes
   the first time.
4. Open the address it prints and sign in with the email and password you used before.

To put a backup back into an instance that already has your business in it (undoing a mistake),
add `--replace` at the end. Everything entered since that backup is lost.

### On Railway

1. Press **Deploy on Railway** in the [README](../README.md) to make a new project, and wait until
   its address shows the page that asks you to create the owner account. Don't create one.
2. In the new project, open the **crewtavo** service, then **Variables**. Change `JWT_SECRET` to the
   old instance's value (and add `ENCRYPTION_KEY` if you had one), then press **Deploy** so every
   service restarts with it.
3. Open the **db** service. Under **Variables**, copy `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Under **Settings →
   Networking**, add a **TCP Proxy** for port `5432` and copy the address it gives, which looks like
   `shuttle.proxy.rlwy.net:12345`.
4. On your computer, open a terminal in the folder that holds the backup file and run this as one
   line, with your file's name, the password and the address in place of the capitals:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/backup" ghcr.io/jviars/crewtavo:latest node scripts/restore.mjs /backup/FILE.dump --db "postgres://postgres:PASSWORD@ADDRESS/postgres?sslmode=disable"
   ```

   (In Windows PowerShell, write `${PWD}` instead of `$PWD`.) It ends with
   `restore: done` and how many clients it now holds.
5. Back in the **db** service's **Settings → Networking**, remove the TCP Proxy.
6. Restart the **crewtavo**, **auth**, **rest** and **storage** services (the ⋮ menu on each
   service's latest deployment, then **Restart**).
7. Open the new project's address and sign in with the email and password you used before. Then
   connect Railway again when Crewtavo asks, and point your own domain at the new project under
   **Settings → Web address**.

While the TCP Proxy is on, the database can be reached from the internet with its password, and
the backup travels to Railway unencrypted (the database's own connections aren't encrypted; the
password itself is never sent in the clear). Do steps 3 to 5 in one sitting, on a network you trust.

## Getting back in

"Forgot password?" emails a reset link once the company has connected its mailbox (**Settings →
Email**). Until then, the sign-in page says it can't send email, and there are two other ways in:

- **Someone on the team:**
  - The owner or an admin opens **Settings → People** and chooses **Reset password** under the
    person's name.
  - If email works, the link is emailed. Otherwise they get a link to hand over in person or by
    text. It works once and stops working within a day.
  - Admins can only do this for people below admin, and the owner for everyone but other owners, so
    nobody can take over an account with as much access as their own.
  - People who also use Crewtavo with another business have to reset it themselves.
  - Each link goes in the activity log, and the person gets a notification about it.
- **The owner: their key file.**
  - When the owner creates their account, Crewtavo has them download a key file
    (`crewtavo-key-file.txt`), or print the keys inside it instead. It won't continue until they
    confirm they saved it.
  - The file holds eight one-time spare keys, like two-factor backup codes. Each upload uses the
    next one, so the file works eight times.
  - Locked out: **Forgot password?**, then **I'm the owner: use my key file**, then upload it and
    choose a new password. With a printout instead, **No file? Type a key** takes their email and one
    key.
  - **Settings → Profile** shows how many uses are left and gets a new key file. It asks for the
    password, and the old file stops working.
  - It only works while email isn't set up. Once the company's email is connected, **Forgot
    password?** sends a link instead.
  - Keys are stored only as keyed hashes, and tries are limited per person and per account.
- **The owner lost their key file too:** whoever helps them proves they control the server.
  1. In Railway, open the project, then the **crewtavo** service, then **Variables**. (On your own
     computer: the `.env.instance` file.)
  2. Add `CREWTAVO_RECOVERY_EMAIL` with the owner's email, and `CREWTAVO_RECOVERY_CODE` with a
     phrase you make up, at least 12 characters. Deploy (on your own computer: `npm run instance`).
  3. Within the next hour, the owner opens **I'm the owner: use my key file**, then **No file? Type
     a key**, and types their email and that phrase, then chooses a new password.
  4. Delete both variables.

  The phrase never appears in the logs and works once, even across restarts. It only works in the
  hour after the server starts with it, and wrong guesses are limited. Anyone who can change those
  variables already controls the whole instance, so it opens no new way in.

After any password reset, Crewtavo signs that account out everywhere else.

## Connecting Claude and ChatGPT

Instances come with this turned on. Open **Settings > AI assistants** in Crewtavo and copy the
connector address (`https://your-domain/mcp`):

- **Claude**: Settings > Connectors > Add custom connector.
- **ChatGPT**: Settings > Apps and connectors > Add (developer mode).

Each person signs in to Crewtavo and approves access on `/oauth/consent`. The assistant can then
look up whatever that person can see, but can't add or change anything until they choose what it
can change (by area: customers, jobs, the schedule, time, quotes, invoices, pay, setup, team), or
give it full access, which also lets it delete, with or without money (Settings > AI assistants,
which everyone has whatever their role). It never gets more than the person's own permissions, and
it can't change anyone's sign-in or spare keys, connected apps or its own access, or refund or
delete a payment. Invitation links are emailed by Crewtavo and never returned to the assistant,
and owners get a notice for every team change an assistant makes. The database holds it to the
same areas as well, through PostgREST's pre-request setting (`pgrst.db_pre_request` on the
`authenticator` role, which the migrations set), with triggers for pay rates, payments, team
changes and time in paid pay periods. If the
database role that runs the migrations isn't allowed to change `authenticator`, the update's log
says so (`migrate: warning in 20261019001040_assistant_access.sql`) with the command to run as a
superuser; then run `notify pgrst, 'reload config';` (or restart the Data API).

An instance's Supabase Auth has no issuer set and signs tokens with the HS256 `JWT_SECRET`, so its
own discovery document has an empty issuer and bare-path endpoints, and it lists the `openid` scope
though it can only sign ID tokens with an RS256 or ES256 key. Crewtavo serves that document fixed
instead (`apps/api/src/lib/authMetadata.ts`), at `/auth/v1/.well-known/*` and the RFC 8414 and
OpenID addresses on its own origin: the issuer connectors are given, full endpoint addresses, and
`openid` only once Auth can sign ID tokens. A connector that asks for `openid` anyway signs in
without an ID token, which MCP doesn't use.
