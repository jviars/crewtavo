/**
 * Password and code guessing, stopped at the instance's gateway (server.ts). GoTrue only limits
 * sign-in attempts per address when told which header to trust, and no header can be trusted on
 * every host (Railway's edge sets one; a Docker install reached directly or through Caddy doesn't),
 * so failures are counted per account instead. After 10 wrong passwords or codes for an email in
 * 15 minutes, password and code sign-in for that email pause for 15 minutes. Successful sign-ins
 * don't count, and an emailed sign-in link (a long token, not a code) still works, so a stranger
 * can't lock anyone out of their account.
 *
 * Counts are shared through Postgres (lib/limit.ts); each process remembers the accounts it has
 * seen paused, so a paused account's attempts never reach GoTrue.
