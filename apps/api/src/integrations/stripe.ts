/**
 * Stripe for a company. A company connects its own key on the Apps page, usually a restricted key
 * from the form the page opens in Stripe (Crewtavo adds the webhook to its Stripe account), or a
 * deployment sets STRIPE_SECRET_KEY for everyone. Then:
 *   - a sent invoice gets a matching Stripe invoice, kept in step by the outbox (syncStripeInvoice)
 *     or made when the client goes to pay from the Client Hub (stripeCheckout);
 *   - webhooks record payments, bank payments on their way, refunds, disputes and deposits, and
 *     bring in invoices made in Stripe (handleStripeEvent);
 *   - importFromStripe brings in past invoices and deposits, quietly;
 *   - switching to a key for another Stripe account (or test to live), or disconnecting, settles
 *     the old account's invoices with the old key (leaveAccount);
 *   - autopay (docs/autopay-plan.md): clients save a card on Stripe's page, finished work is charged
 *     to it as a charge_automatically Stripe invoice, tips go on it after paying, and the office
 *     refunds from Crewtavo. Only with the company's own key.
 * Uses the admin client; every query filters by company.

 * booked to it; what was owed from before is the client's, without an invoice (`<charge>:before`,
 * so a refund or a lost dispute of the charge takes it back too). A credit note issued in Stripe
 * before it was paid took its amount off what Stripe asked for, so that's booked to it as well.
 *
 * Credit that pays all of the invoice goes on to the tip (Stripe puts the balance on all it asks

 * covers the tip too leaves nothing to charge. The credit and the charge each carry the part of the
