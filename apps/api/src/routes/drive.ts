/**
 * Crewtavo - Drive (Apps → Crewtavo - Drive): every file in one place. Drive's files are plan files
 * (supabase/migrations/20261028000300_drive.sql), each in a company folder or on a client's property,
 * request, quote or job, and the web app lists, uploads, moves, renames, attaches, trashes and
 * restores them itself, under row-level security. These routes do what the browser can't:
 *
 *   POST /api/drive/enabled                  Install and Uninstall (owners and admins who connect apps)
 *   POST /api/drive/import                   files picked in Google Drive, brought into a folder or onto
 *                                            a client's property, request, quote or job
 *   POST /api/drive/trash/:id/to-drive       a file from elsewhere in Crewtavo (a visit photo, a
 *                                            guide's cover), out of the Trash and into Drive's
 *                                            "Restored files" folder, when what it was on is gone
 *                                            (never paperwork, résumés or receipts)
 *   POST /api/drive/trash/delete-forever     things in the Trash, deleted for good now (owners only)
 *
 * Importing: the web app signs the person in to Google with its file picker, which lets Crewtavo
 * read only the files they pick (the drive.file permission), and sends that sign-in here with the
 * files. It must be for this deployment's own Google app (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID), and it's used for those
 * files and forgotten: never kept, never logged. Each file is downloaded whole (Google's own Docs,
 * Sheets, Slides and Drawings converted: packages/core/src/drive.ts), stored, then recorded as the
 * person, so the database's rules about who adds files where apply as they do in the browser.
 *
 * The Trash is the database's (drive_trash, drive_restore): nothing a person deletes is gone until
 * the nightly purge (services/planFiles.ts) or an owner's Delete forever here. The database decides
 * which stored files go (trash_delete_forever, trash_copied_to_drive): it deletes the rows first, then
 * hands over only the files nothing uses any more, and only those are removed.
