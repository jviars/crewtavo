/**
 * Settings → Hosting → Files storage: moving this Crewtavo's photos and files from the storage
 * service's Railway volume into a Railway bucket with one press, and back again.
 *
 * A bucket costs a tenth of a volume per GB and never fills up, but Railway's Limited Trial has no
 * buckets and Railway backs up volumes (on Pro) and not buckets, so the template keeps the volume
 * (.railway/railway.ts) and an owner who wants the bucket moves here. A move:
 *  1. finds or makes the bucket ("files") in the project, near the storage service, and reads its
 *     S3 keys (bucketS3Credentials);
 *  2. copies every file: reads it from Storage (its private address, with the service key) and
 *     streams it into the bucket at exactly the key Storage's S3 backend reads (below), a few at a
 *     time, skipping what's already there; then again for files added meanwhile;
 *  3. checks the bucket has every file at its size, and only then
 *  4. switches: sets the storage service's variables (STORAGE_BACKEND=s3 and the bucket's, as
 *     references to it) and restarts storage. Uploads are turned away meanwhile, for a minute or
 *     two (storageWritesPaused), and files that still land on the volume are copied until the
 *     restart takes;
 *  5. checks every file is in the bucket and a few read back through Storage.
 * Every step is saved (the integrations row "railway_storage"), so the page shows how far along it
 * is and a restart carries on from there. The volume is never changed: it keeps every file from
 * before the move, so moving back is the switch the other way plus copying back what was added
 * since. Anything Railway doesn't let Crewtavo do becomes steps to do in Railway (StorageByHand).
 *
 * Where Storage keeps each file (supabase/storage v1.82.1, the version the template runs):
 *  - storage.objects has a row per file: bucket_id, name, version, and metadata, which is what the
 *    backend reported after the upload (mimetype, cacheControl, contentEncoding, size).
 *  - Its key is `${TENANT_ID}/${bucket_id}/${name}/${version}`: TenantLocation.getKeyLocation in
 *    src/storage/locator.ts, with withOptionalVersion from src/storage/backend/adapter.ts, which
 *    joins the version with "/" (with "-$v-" when TUS_USE_FILE_VERSION_SEPARATOR=true) and leaves
 *    it off when it's null. TENANT_ID is "crewtavo" in the template (PROJECT_REF wins when set, and
 *    "storage-single-tenant" is the default; src/config.ts).
 *  - The file backend (src/storage/backend/file.ts) keeps it at
 *    `${FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND_PATH}/${STORAGE_S3_BUCKET || GLOBAL_S3_BUCKET}/${key}`, with the
 *    content type, cache control and content encoding as extended attributes
 *    (user.supabase.content-type, user.supabase.cache-control, user.supabase.content-encoding),
 *    read back as application/octet-stream and no-cache when missing. Its ETag is the MD5.
 *  - The S3 backend (src/storage/backend/s3/adapter.ts) keeps it in the bucket STORAGE_S3_BUCKET at
 *    the same key, with ContentType, CacheControl and ContentEncoding as the object's own headers
 *    (the same defaults on read). A single PUT's ETag is the MD5 too.
 * So a file PUT at that key with Content-Type = metadata.mimetype, Cache-Control =
 * metadata.cacheControl (and Content-Encoding, which Crewtavo never uses, so such a file is left
 * for a person rather than copied) reads back through Storage exactly as it did, and its row,
 * version and owner don't change. Storage picks one backend as it starts
 * (src/storage/backend/index.ts), so there's no per-file fallback; and the file backend's folder is
 * STORAGE_S3_BUCKET when that's set, so moving back sets it to the volume's folder again.
 *
 * Moving back writes files through Storage (nothing else reaches the volume), so each file copied
 * back gets a new version; its name, owner and contents stay. Crewtavo never writes over a stored
 * file (every upload has a new name and x-upsert false), so that can't overwrite a newer upload;
 * it still checks the row is there at the same version right before writing. Deleting carries on
 * meanwhile, and Storage's write makes a new row when it finds none (it has no "only replace"), so
 * a file deleted while its copy streamed would come back: the row is checked again after the write
 * (Storage keeps a row's id when it writes over it, so a new id is the copy's own row) and such a
 * copy is taken out again, or kept on the move's record (strays) until Storage lets Crewtavo.
 *
 * Moving back finishes only once storage's settings in Railway say the volume too: a move whose
 * undo couldn't reach Railway can leave them saying the bucket while storage still reads the volume,
 * and storage would go back to the bucket at its next restart.
 *
 * Which place Storage reads from is told by two small files in Storage's "files" bucket, under
 * MARKERS (no business can see them: they're under no business's folder): one written while on the
 * volume and never copied to the bucket, one written while on the bucket and never copied back.
 * Storage answers 200 for the one where it reads, and "not found" (S3) or an error (the volume) for
 * the other.
