/**
 * Google review requests, Jobber's way (docs/marketing-plan.md): a short message with a tracked link
 * that redirects to the company's review page (settings.review_url), by email, text or both, and up
 * to two reminders for anyone who hasn't opened it. Clicks are recorded so Marketing can show what
 * works, and a click stops the reminders.
 *
 * An ask sent by an automation (`automatic`) holds to more than one sent by hand: it skips clients
 * asked in the last 6 months, and between 9pm and 9am in the company's time zone it goes by email
 * only, or waits for 9am when a text is the only way (WaitUntil: the engine puts the run back). Asks
 * by hand go right away. Neither goes to clients who opted out, are archived or already left a
 * Google review (matched in Marketing → Reviews, services/googleReviews.ts), and nothing goes while
 * Marketing is uninstalled. A link copied by hand isn't an ask until it's opened.
 *
 * Reminders (sendDueReminders, every five minutes) go at 1:30pm on the chosen days, by the ask's own
 * channels, with the same tracked link. Each one lands in the client's messages like the ask. When
 * the days change, the reminders still to come move to them (rescheduleReminders).
 *
 * The tracked link is short (/api/public/r/<the ask's link_token>), so a text fits in fewer
 * segments, and a text ends with "Reply STOP to opt out." (withStopLine) unless the business's own
 * words already say STOP. An ask that went one way but not the other says so (`warning`), with why.
