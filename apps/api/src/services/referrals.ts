/**
 * Asking a client for referrals, Jobber's way (docs/marketing-plan.md, phase B): an email with
 * their own referral link (the public referral page, routes/public.ts), saying what their friend and
 * they get, with one-click unsubscribe. Email only, and no reminders. It lands in the client's
 * messages like a review ask.
 *
 * An ask sent by the starter rule (`automatic`) skips what it can't send (Marketing is off,
 * Referrals have no credit or offer, the client opted out of marketing, is archived or has no email)
 * and clients asked in the last 6 months, and waits while the client's review reminders are still
 * going out, so they aren't sent both at once. One by hand goes right away, or says why it can't.
 * Every ask that went counts toward the 6 months (begin_referral_ask).
