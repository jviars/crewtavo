/**
 * Settings → Storage from the server's side (packages/core/src/storage.ts; the database's part is
 * supabase/migrations/20261028000400_storage_limits.sql):
 *  - the default company limit, kept current from Railway (keepStorageDefault): 90% of the storage
 *    service's volume, or what the Railway plan allows a bucket. It's read again when Settings →
 *    Hosting or Settings → Storage read Railway, by the "hosting" and "storage" tasks, and when a
 *    storage move finishes, and written with storage_set_default (the server's alone), which keeps
 *    every other setting as it is. Off Railway, or once Railway isn't connected, there's no default
 *    (one Railway gave earlier no longer says anything true); the same when Railway answers but
 *    what it says gives no default (a plan Crewtavo doesn't know). Only while Railway can't be
 *    reached for a moment does the last default stay.
 *  - GET /api/storage's overview (storageOverviewFor): storage_overview as the person sees it, plus,
 *    for owners and admins on Railway, where files live and what a GB of them costs a month.
 *  - the "storage" task's warnings (checkStorage): owners and admins hear (the bell, plus email and
 *    push by their notification settings: the "hosting" topic on Railway, "alerts" elsewhere, where
 *    "hosting" isn't shown) when the company's files reach 80% and 95% of its limit, once each
 *    time; what was sent is kept in companies.settings.storage.warned and cleared when use drops
 *    back under, so the next time it's crossed they hear again.
