/**
 * Autopay (docs/autopay-plan.md): a client's saved card or bank account, charged on the server once
 * the work is done. The rules live in Postgres (supabase/migrations/20261101000100_autopay.sql: what
 * is queued, when it falls due, what may be charged without asking) and Stripe is spoken to in
 * integrations/stripe.ts. Here:
 *   - the 5-minute task that charges what's due (chargeDueAutopay), holding each row with a claim
 *     token, so two servers, or a run that overlaps the last, never charge one twice;
 *   - the emails the database queues in the outbox: the receipt, the notice of a failed charge and
 *     the client's copy of what they agreed to (runAutopayJob). They never go from the task itself;
 *   - invites to set it up (sendAutopayInvite), for the office and for automations;
 *   - the Client Hub's autopay facts and steps: setting up, agreeing, turning it off, and a tip on
 *     the saved card after an automatic charge;
 *   - what Settings → Payments shows (autopayStatus).
 * Uses the admin client, and every lookup filters by company. Crews never reach any of it.
