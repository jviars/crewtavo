/**
 * The office's quote page (/quotes/:id), for every trade and for change orders: its lines, message,
 * totals, deposit, template and contract, sending it, and what comes after (approved, a job, lost).
 * Its lines show as an editable list or as the paper it prints as (the Paper view), and "Print or
 * save PDF" prints those same pages.
 *
 * A quote that offers options (quote_options) has the options bar above its lines (QuoteOptions.tsx).
 * Looking at an option changes nothing for the customer: the page shows that option's lines, totals,
 * contract and paper. Marking it approved, or making it a job, first asks which option they chose,
 * and an approval made here keeps that option and the contract as they read then (quotes.approval),
 * as a signature on the Client Hub or the iPad does. The option math is core money.ts; options.ts has
 * the option records.
