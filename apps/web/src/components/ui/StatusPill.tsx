/*
 * Status words: the one place they're written. Each kind of record, its states, and the label each
 * state gets everywhere (two words at most). Anything else that names a state, a filter, a column, a
 * stat, a picker, uses statusText or these same words, so a state never reads two ways.
 *
 *   Client   lead "Lead" · active "Active" · archived "Archived"
 *   Request  new "New" · assessment_scheduled "Assessment booked" · assessment_complete "Assessment done" ·
 *            quoted "Quoted" · converted "Converted" · archived "Archived"
 *   Quote    draft "Draft" · sent "Awaiting response" · changes_requested "Changes requested" ·
 *            approved "Approved" · converted "Converted" · lost "Lost" · archived "Archived"
 *   Job      active "Active" · requires_invoicing "Requires invoicing" · completed "Completed" · archived "Archived"
 *   Invoice  draft "Draft" · sent "Awaiting payment" · partially_paid "Partly paid" · paid "Paid" ·
 *            overdue "Past due" · void "Void" · written_off "Written off"
 *   Visit    unscheduled "Unscheduled" · scheduled "Scheduled" · en_route "On the way" ·
 *            in_progress "In progress" · completed "Completed" · cancelled "Cancelled"
 *
 * Money that's late is "Past due", never "Overdue" or "Waiting on payment". "Overdue" is kept for work
 * that's late: a new request nobody has answered in two days (Home's workflow), a visit past its day,
 * equipment maintenance. packages/core/src/automations.ts (STATUS_CHOICES) repeats these words for the
 * automation builder, so change both together. A paving or roofing project's stage ("Proposal sent",
 * "Won") is its own thing, worded in features/paving/data.ts and features/roofing/data.ts.
